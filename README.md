Third project for the OpenClassRooms/Capgemini training.

To run the project on Tomcat server simply enter in a terminal: $ mvn tomcat7:run
If this one doesn't do the trick use: $ mvn tomcat7:run -pl :web -am

You can also configure a maven run in Eclipse with the goal: tomcat7:run

The project will be then running on: http://localhost:8080/climbing
